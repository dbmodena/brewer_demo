# BrewER Demo

BrewER is our framework to perform entity resolution on-demand, whose reference research paper [1] has been presented at VLDB 2022.

Here we provide the code of our framework as presented in our demo paper [2], accepted for VLDB 2023.

The code of BrewER itself, contained in the file "brewer.py", has been refined from the original version; we also provide as a reference an expanded version of the camera dataset used in our research paper [1]. We will gradually upload the other datasets that we will use in our demo and add more functionalities to the provided code.
